Measure first, optimize second. No assumptions — evidence only. Persist to ai/review/.

## Process

1. Establish baseline — measure before touching anything
2. Profile to find actual hot paths (don't guess)
3. Analyze root cause (complexity, allocations, I/O, concurrency, cache)
4. Recommend with expected impact
5. Measure after — report delta

## Analysis Focus

| Category    | Check                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Complexity  | O(n²) where O(n) possible                        |
| Allocations | Unnecessary copies, String vs &str, clone()      |
| I/O         | Blocking in async, unbuffered reads, N+1 queries |
| Concurrency | Lock contention, false sharing, rayon vs tokio   |
| Caching     | Missing cache, invalidation bugs                 |

## Output (profile.md)

# Profile: [target]

## Baseline

[measured performance — command + output]

## Hot Paths

From profiler output, not guesses.

## Recommendations

| Fix | Expected Impact | Effort |
| --- | --------------- | ------ |
| ... | ...             | ...    |

## Results

Before vs after measurements.
